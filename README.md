# Image-Shifting-in-machine-Learning
This project explains how images are shift using the popular mnist dataset

## Basic Concept of machine learning
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy. It uses statistics and data to build intelligent computer systems. To design a machine learning module, you train the module with data which comes in many forms such as text, audio, video or images.

## About this Project
This project is about image shifting during machine learning training which is a method that can be used to increase the training dataset to improve the accuracy of your model.


## To run this code
You required to have anaconda and jupyter notebook installed or visual studio code with all necessary libraries like pandas, numpy and scikit learn

## Importance of Shifting images

Shifting images left, right, up, or down can be a very useful transformation to avoid positional bias in the data. For example, if all the images in a dataset are centered, which is common in face recognition datasets, this would require the model to be tested on perfectly centered images as well. It helps to introduce dynamism in the dataset to train your model
